Kanava
======
Kanava is an EAKR (EU) funded project that aims to combine social media and city environment for the benefit of local
culture institutes and artists. The project is executed in collaboration between the city of Rovaniemi and University 
of Lapland.

The idea is to bring conversations from social media to new environment. The end product is a projection mapping 
installation in the city centre that gathers and presents information and conversations (posts and comments) from 
Kanava Facebook-page. The projection mapping also reacts to tweets with certain Lapland related hashtags.

From GitHub you can find the Quartz Composer source code of Kanava. Feel free to use, modify and learn from it. Kanava
